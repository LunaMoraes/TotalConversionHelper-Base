# This file contains the setup effects for the tributaries in the game.
# The setup_tributaries_effect is invoked by on_game_start and should make calls to subsequent scripted effects.
# Sections are organized by top-suzerain title.
# Note that existing vassals (as established in title history) must be released and recreated into tributaries before
# they can have their own tributaries.

# $TRIBUTARY$ = the new tributary
# $SUZERAIN$ = their suzerain
# $WAR$ = determines if this was caused by war or agreement, yes or no
